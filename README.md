# cocktail-project


## Goal of the App:

It’s a project to list the cocktails, sort them, filter them. Basically manage the lists of cocktails to provide to the user all the recipes and ideas to have fun making cocktails. Furthermore, with a ‘nice to have’ section  we can also provide a user personal account so that they can customize their personal cocktails to the public. (To post a drink, we have to contact the administrator of the API)
